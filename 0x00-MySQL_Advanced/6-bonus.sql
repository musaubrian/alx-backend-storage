-- SQL script that creates a stored procedure AddBonus
-- that adds a new correction for a student.
-- Requirements:

-- Procedure AddBonus is taking 3 inputs (in this order):
-- 1. user_id, a users.id value (you can assume user_id is linked to an existing users)
-- 2. project_name, a new or already exists projects - if no projects.name found in the table, 
--      you should create it
-- 3. score, the score value for the correction

CREATE PROCEDURE AddBonus (
  IN user_id int,
  IN project_name varchar(255),
  IN score float)
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO projects (name)
  SELECT project_name FROM DUAL

  WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM projects WHERE name = project_name);
  INSERT INTO corrections (user_id, project_id, score)
  VALUES (user_id, (SELECT id FROM projects WHERE name = project_name), score);
END;
